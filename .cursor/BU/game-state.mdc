# State Management (Game Logic)

The core game logic and state are centralized in [src/components/GameProvider.tsx](mdc:src/components/GameProvider.tsx).

- It uses the **React Context API** (`createContext`, `useContext`) to provide game state and actions to components.
- **Key states managed**: `currentWord`, `solvedWordIds`, game statistics (`wins`, `losses`, `streak`), `keyboardLayout`, `gameStatus`, `currentGrade`, `wordList`.
- **Core functions**: `loadWordList`, `pickNewWord`, `handlePressLetter`, `saveGameState`, `loadGameState`.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses `AsyncStorage` (via `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`) to save and load game state (stats, settings).
- **Sound Effects**: Manages loading and playing sound effects using `expo-av`.

When modifying game rules, player stats, or word handling, this provider is the primary file to check.
